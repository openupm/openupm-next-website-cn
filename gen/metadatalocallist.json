By attaching your iPhone to the HoloKit, you can enjoy a captivating AR experience. Utilizing Apple Vision framework, the SDK detects user hand poses. Together with LiDAR depth sensor, it allows your iPhone to track the 3D positions of the user's hands. Furthermore, the SDK can recognize hand gestures such as pinching, serving as a trigger for specific operations in your project.\n\nHoloKit Unity SDK, built on the foundation of ARFoundation, is compatible with most ARFoundation features such as image tracking and plane detection.
