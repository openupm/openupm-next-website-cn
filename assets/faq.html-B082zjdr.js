You can only specify a specific version number.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use Git dependencies in manifest.json or the dependencies of package.json?</strong></p><p>Git dependencies are only supported in manifest.json, but not in the dependencies of package.json.</p><p><strong>Q: How can I deprecate a package version?</strong></p><p>While package deprecation is a feature of NPM, it is not implemented by the Unity Package Manager in the Editor. Therefore, we do not support it at the moment.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the package unpublish policy?</strong></p>",7),y=r("<p><strong>Q: Should I use a specific scope like <code>com.foo.bar</code> or a broader scope like <code>com.foo</code> when installing a package?</strong></p><p>The OpenUPM website and openupm-cli use specific scopes like <code>com.foo.bar</code> when installing packages. This approach is taken because we don&#39;t assume that all packages under the same scope are hosted on OpenUPM. As a user, you have the choice to use a broader scope like <code>com.foo</code> if you have more than one package under the same scope. This can result in faster network access when resolving packages from the registry.</p><p><strong>Q: How does the README file sync work?</strong></p><p>OpenUPM displays the README file from your GitHub repository as your package&#39;s front page. The path of the README file is specified in the <code>readme</code> field of the package metadata YAML file, for example, <code>readme: &#39;main:README.md&#39;</code>. The sync process is triggered every few hours.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I add a commercial option for my open-source packages?</strong></p>",5),f={href:"https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service/software/package-guidelines",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},k=e("blockquote",null,[e("p",null,"You cannot make any Package (including via Package update) available from within the Unity Editor to third parties (other than your Designated Users) that, directly or indirectly, advances or is intended to advance the commercial or economic interests of you and/or your affiliated entities.
