How do you trigger a rebuild? The solution is to re-tag the existing Git tag.</p><p>When the build pipelines detect a failed Git tag that has been re-tagged, it will initiate a rebuild. It&#39;s important to note that the build pipelines will not rebuild an already successful release, even if they detect that the Git tag has been removed or re-tagged. This is because what has been released on the registry is immutable.</p><p>To re-tag an existing Git tag, you can follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Locate the Git tag on the GitHub website.</li><li>Delete the existing tag.</li><li>Create a new tag with the same name from the latest commit.</li></ol><p>Alternatively, you can use the following commands to re-tag a Git tag:</p><div class="language-bash" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token comment"># List all remote tags</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> ls-remote <span class="token parameter variable">--tags</span>

<span class="token comment"># Delete the local tag</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> tag <span class="token parameter variable">-d</span> v1.0.1

<span class="token comment"># Push the tag deletion to the remote</span>
<span class="token function">git</span> push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1

</code></pre></div><p>Some repositories adhere to an immutable policy that disallows re-tagging. In such cases, you can trigger a new build by incrementing the package version. For instance, if the erroneous Git tag is <code>v1.0.1</code>, you should update the package version to <code>1.0.2</code> and then create a new Git tag, <code>v1.0.2</code>, to initiate a new build.</p>`,8);function E(x,G){const r=s("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),l("div",null,[h,e("p",null,[p,t(" are typically caused by temporary issues, such as network problems, and the build pipelines will automatically attempt to retry them up to three times.
